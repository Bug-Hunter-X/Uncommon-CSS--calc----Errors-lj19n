The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior.  For example, trying to subtract a percentage from a pixel value without proper parentheses can lead to errors.  `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works correctly, but `width: calc(100% - 10px);` (missing parentheses) will likely fail.  Another issue is using incompatible units within a single `calc()` expression; for example, mixing `px` and `em` units in a way that's not supported by the browser could produce unexpected rendering.
